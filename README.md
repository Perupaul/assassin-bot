# assassin-bot
A discord bot for managing a game of assassin with 20+ players. This was a passion project with one sole developer, so I pushed it all to git in one instant. It has not been tested since being uploaded.
Some data has not been uploaded to github, as such it will not run without a 'Espionage Challenge.csv' being created or a 'assassins.json' file.
